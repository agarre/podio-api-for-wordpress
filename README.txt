Podio API for Wordpress
=======================

This plugin makes the API available to Wordpress.

Upon activation, an options section will appear where one is required to enter the Podio username an password. The login information is stored in the database, and after login, one is able to make calls to the Podio API (https://developers.podio.com/)

(Coda 2 git test.)
